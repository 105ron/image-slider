# Creating an Image Carousel/Slider

Create a simple image carousel site. It should contain arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backwards. It should automatically move forward every 5 seconds. It should contain the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on.

This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) JavaScript track. See [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/creating-an-image-carousel-slider?ref=lnav) for more information.
